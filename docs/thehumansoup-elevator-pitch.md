# The Human Soup Elevator Pitch

## One-liner
The Human Soup turns scattered creator content into a living, open graph that your personal AI can search, filter, and summarize for you.

## Short Version
Today, your favorite creators are split across newsletters, YouTube, podcasts, and social platforms. The Human Soup connects all of that into one open, AI-traversable index so your personal AI can find what matters and bring you a calm, curated digest.

## What It Is (Non-Technical)
Think of it as a pantry of everything your favorite people publish. Instead of you hunting across apps, your AI "cooks" what you actually want to read, watch, or listen to.

## The Problem
Discovery is broken:
- Newsletters are locked to email and hard to search.
- Platforms keep content in silos and optimize for their own engagement.
- RSS is powerful but outdated and too manual for most people.

## The Insight
Creators already publish a machine-readable "about me + my content" file (`me.json`) in the me3 ecosystem. The missing piece is a shared index that connects those files into a single, open graph an AI can understand.

## The Solution
The Human Soup aggregates me3 sites into an open content graph that AI agents can query. That means your personal AI can:
- Track what is new from people you follow.
- Discover creators aligned with your interests.
- Build a digest that respects your time and attention.

## "Subscribe" Redefined
Subscribing is not "send me emails." It is "my AI should pay attention to this person."

That single intent works across formats:
- Essays and articles
- Short notes
- Videos and shorts
- Podcasts and audio
- Images and links

## How It Feels (User Experience)
You do not get an algorithmic feed. You get a personal editor.
- Your AI knows who you follow and what you care about.
- It scans the soup for what is new and relevant.
- It delivers a small, thoughtful digest you can trust.

## What Makes It Different
| Dimension | Traditional Platforms | The Human Soup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who it serves | Platforms | Humans and their AI |
| Discovery | Manual or engagement-driven | Personal and interest-aware |
| Formats | Siloed by app | All formats, one graph |
| Subscriptions | Platform-locked | Open, portable intent |
| Outcome | Endless scrolling | Calm, curated signal |

## Example
You: "What is new from the people I follow?"

Your AI: "Here are three things worth your time today: one essay on AI tooling, one short note on startup life, and one 6-minute video you will enjoy."

The Human Soup makes that possible.

## The Soup Metaphor
- The soup is the total mix of human-made content.
- Ingredients are individual posts, videos, or notes.
- Your AI is the chef, choosing what fits your taste.
- The recipe is your personal digest.

It is warm, open, and human-first by design.

## Why It Matters
The Human Soup flips the internet's power dynamic. The intelligence sits with the human and their AI, not inside a closed platform. Creators stay sovereign. Audiences get signal, not noise.
