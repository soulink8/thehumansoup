The Human Soup
One-Liner

The Human Soup is an open content network that lets your personal AI find, filter, and curate what matters — without algorithms, silos, or platform lock-in.

Short Version

Today, the people you care about publish everywhere:

Newsletters

YouTube

Podcasts

Blogs

Social platforms

The Human Soup connects it all into one open, AI-traversable network so your personal AI can discover signal, not noise.

Instead of scrolling feeds, your AI cooks a calm, curated digest tailored to you.

What It Is (Non-Technical)

Think of it like this:

The internet is a giant pot of content.

The Human Soup is a clean, open pantry where creators publish in a machine-readable way.

Your AI is the chef.

It gathers ingredients (articles, videos, notes, audio), selects what fits your interests, and serves you only what’s worth your time.

No addictive feed.
No hidden algorithm.
No platform deciding what you see.

Just signal.

The Problem

Discovery is broken.

Newsletters are locked in inboxes.

YouTube and social platforms trap content inside silos.

RSS is powerful but too manual for most people.

Algorithms optimise for engagement — not clarity.

Following someone means something different on every platform.

Creators are scattered.
Audiences are overwhelmed.
AI assistants have nowhere clean to look.

The Insight

Creators already publish structured data about themselves and their content through me.json (via the me3 ecosystem).

That means:

Identity is machine-readable.

Content is structured.

Intent (like subscribing) is explicit.

Ownership stays with the creator.

What’s missing is a shared index — a place AI agents can traverse.

The Human Soup is that index.

The Solution

The Human Soup aggregates participating creators into an open content graph that AI agents can query.

This allows your personal AI to:

Track what’s new from people you follow

Discover creators aligned with your interests

Compare viewpoints across topics

Build a digest that respects your attention

The Soup does not rank content.

It does not optimise engagement.

It simply makes everything discoverable and structured.

Your AI decides what matters.

“Subscribe” Redefined

On traditional platforms:

Newsletter signup = emails

YouTube subscribe = platform lock-in

Twitter follow = algorithmic exposure

Substack subscribe = email silo

In The Human Soup:

Subscribing means: “My AI should pay attention to this person.”

It applies to:

Essays

Notes

Videos

Podcasts

Images

Links

Any format

It’s format-agnostic and platform-independent.

Subscription becomes intent — not delivery mechanism.

What Makes It Different
Dimension Traditional Platforms The Human Soup
Who it serves Platforms Humans and their AI
Discovery Engagement-driven Interest-aware
Formats Siloed by app Unified
Identity Platform-bound Sovereign
Subscriptions Locked Portable
Intelligence Algorithm controls Your AI controls
Outcome Endless scrolling Calm signal
How It Feels

You:
“What’s worth my time today?”

Your AI:
“Three things:
• A short essay on AI tooling
• A 6-minute video on Cloudflare Workers
• A thoughtful note on startup economics”

No scrolling.

No manipulation.

Just relevance.

The Soup Metaphor

The soup is the total mix of human-made content.

Ingredients are individual posts, videos, or notes.

Creators bring flavour.

Your AI is the chef.

The recipe is your personalised digest.

It is warm, open, and human-first by design.

Why It Matters

The internet shifted power toward platforms.

The Human Soup shifts it back:

Creators remain sovereign.

Identity stays portable.

Discovery becomes open infrastructure.

Intelligence sits with the human and their AI.

It is not a new social network.

It is not a new feed.

It is infrastructure for the AI era.

The Bigger Vision

In the near future, everyone will have a personal AI assistant.

But today, those assistants are trapped inside closed ecosystems.

The Human Soup gives AI agents:

A clean, open, structured content layer

A trust-aware identity graph

A portable subscription model

A neutral public-good index

It becomes the content layer for personal AI.

What It Is Not

Not an algorithmic feed

Not a platform competing for attention

Not a content host

Not a walled garden

Not surveillance-driven

It is an open network.

Status

The Human Soup is being built as:

Open source

Agent-first

Protocol-aligned

Public-good infrastructure

It begins with the me3 ecosystem and can extend outward.
